# Fancy Console

**This is just a prototype and it doesn't work extensively**

### Why

No real reason.  I became interested in parsing markdown and wanted to see how far it could be rendered in the browswer console.  I also wanted to learn about js proxies.

The other idea is that libraries could inline their documentation to their non optimzed file.  Then the user could look up the docs for the library right in the browser console and get a decent render with in line live objects.  This is an example of what it looks like:
